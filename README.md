1. Since the imported music text is for instrument Drum. the clef is shown as percussion. We identified the position of notes based on their notes octave, for instance, we covered notes from C4 up to G5. We haven't not included note elements such as Duration, noteHead and Chord into our implementation , i.e. eighth, sixteenth, thus our music sheet does not show the variety of music notes yet.
